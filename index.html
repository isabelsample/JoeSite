		<p>Joe Abrams is a musician ~ A songwriter, vocalist, performing & recording artist, multi-instrumentalist, collaborator, teacher and music publisher. 

		He has a heavily improvisational approach to performing his songs and the rare cover song. He has recorded several albums in which he wrote and played all of the instruments.</p>

		<p>He has also had groups with the musical talents of Brad Houser (edie brickell and the new bohemians), Ben Shepherd (Soundgarden)and collaborations with Andy Wood (Mother Love Bone) and Stone Gossard (MLB & Pearl Jam).</p>

		<p>With another full length album almost complete (as of February 2016) and a reunion show with his former band "MACAW" scheduled for 2/27/16 at the Royal Room for the OK Hotel Reunion and after years of honing his craft as a "solo" performer, he is more than ready to have a performing band and get this music to the masses. It's time.</p>

		<p>So, a Manager for this artist is probably in order. Are you one? ;)</p>
